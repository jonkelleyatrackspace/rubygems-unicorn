  body: sets the working directory for Unicorn. This ensures SIGUSR2 will start a new instance of Unicorn in this directory. This may be a symlink, a common scenario for Capistrano users. Unlike all other Unicorn configuration directives, this binds immediately for error checking and cannot be undone by unsetting it in the configuration file and reloading.
