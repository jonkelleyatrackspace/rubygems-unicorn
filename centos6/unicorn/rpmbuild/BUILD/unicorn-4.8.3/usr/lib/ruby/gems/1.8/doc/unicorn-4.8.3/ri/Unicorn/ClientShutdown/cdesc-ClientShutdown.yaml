  body: Raised inside TeeInput when a client closes the socket inside the application dispatch. This is always raised with an empty backtrace since there is nothing in the application stack that is responsible for client shutdowns/disconnects. This exception is visible to Rack applications unless PrereadInput middleware is loaded.
