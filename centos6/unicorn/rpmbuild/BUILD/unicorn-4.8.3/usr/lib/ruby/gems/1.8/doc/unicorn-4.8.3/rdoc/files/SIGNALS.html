      <h2>Signal handling</h2>
<p>
In general, signals need only be sent to the master process. However, the
signals <a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> uses internally to
communicate with the worker processes are documented here as well. With the
exception of TTIN/TTOU, signal handling matches the behavior of <a
href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a> so it should be possible to easily share
process management scripts between <a
href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> and nginx.
</p>
<p>
One example init script is distributed with unicorn: <a
href="http://unicorn.bogomips.org/examples/init.sh">unicorn.bogomips.org/examples/init.sh</a>
</p>
<h3>Master Process</h3>
<ul>
<li>HUP - reloads config file and gracefully restart all workers. If the
&quot;preload_app&quot; directive is false (the default), then workers will
also pick up any application code changes when restarted. If
&quot;preload_app&quot; is true, then application code changes will have no
effect; USR2 + QUIT (see below) must be used to load newer code in this
case. When reloading the application, +Gem.refresh+ will be called so
updated code for your application can pick up newly installed RubyGems. It
is not recommended that you uninstall libraries your application depends on
while <a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> is running, as
respawned workers may enter a spawn loop when they fail to load an
uninstalled dependency.

</li>
<li>INT/TERM - quick shutdown, kills all workers immediately

</li>
<li>QUIT - graceful shutdown, waits for workers to finish their current request
before finishing.

</li>
<li>USR1 - reopen all logs owned by the master and all workers See
Unicorn::Util.reopen_logs for what is considered a log.

</li>
<li>USR2 - reexecute the running binary. A separate QUIT should be sent to the
original process once the child is verified to be up and running.

</li>
<li>WINCH - gracefully stops workers but keep the master running. This will
only work for daemonized processes.

</li>
<li>TTIN - increment the number of worker processes by one

</li>
<li>TTOU - decrement the number of worker processes by one

</li>
</ul>
<h3>Worker Processes</h3>
<p>
Note: as of unicorn 4.8, the master uses a pipe to signal workers instead
of kill(2) for most cases. Using signals still (and works and remains
supported for external tools/libraries), however.
</p>
<p>
Sending signals directly to the worker processes should not normally be
needed. If the master process is running, any exited worker will be
automatically respawned.
</p>
<ul>
<li>INT/TERM - Quick shutdown, immediately exit. Unless WINCH has been sent to
the master (or the master is killed), the master process will respawn a
worker to replace this one. Immediate shutdown is still triggered using
kill(2) and not the internal pipe as of unicorn 4.8

</li>
<li>QUIT - Gracefully exit after finishing the current request. Unless WINCH
has been sent to the master (or the master is killed), the master process
will respawn a worker to replace this one.

</li>
<li>USR1 - Reopen all logs owned by the worker process. See
Unicorn::Util.reopen_logs for what is considered a log. Log files are not
reopened until it is done processing the current request, so multiple log
lines for one request (as done by Rails) will not be split across multiple
logs.

<p>
It is NOT recommended to send the USR1 signal directly to workers via
&quot;killall -USR1 unicorn&quot; if you are using user/group-switching
support in your workers. You will encounter incorrect file permissions and
workers will need to be respawned. Sending USR1 to the master process first
will ensure logs have the correct permissions before the master forwards
the USR1 signal to workers.
</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>Procedure to replace a running unicorn executable</h3>
<p>
You may replace a running instance of unicorn with a new one without losing
any incoming connections. Doing so will reload all of your application
code, <a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> config, Ruby
executable, and all libraries. The only things that will not change (due to
OS limitations) are:
</p>
<ol>
<li>The path to the unicorn executable script. If you want to change to a
different installation of Ruby, you can modify the shebang line to point to
your alternative interpreter.

</li>
</ol>
<p>
The procedure is exactly like that of nginx:
</p>
<ol>
<li>Send USR2 to the master process

</li>
<li>Check your process manager or pid files to see if a new master spawned
successfully. If you&#8216;re using a pid file, the old process will have
&quot;.oldbin&quot; appended to its path. You should have two master
instances of unicorn running now, both of which will have workers servicing
requests. Your process tree should look something like this:

<pre>
  unicorn master (old)
  \_ unicorn worker[0]
  \_ unicorn worker[1]
  \_ unicorn worker[2]
  \_ unicorn worker[3]
  \_ unicorn master
     \_ unicorn worker[0]
     \_ unicorn worker[1]
     \_ unicorn worker[2]
     \_ unicorn worker[3]
</pre>
</li>
<li>You can now send WINCH to the old master process so only the new workers
serve requests. If your unicorn process is bound to an interactive terminal
(not daemonized), you can skip this step. Step 5 will be more difficult but
you can also skip it if your process is not daemonized.

</li>
<li>You should now ensure that everything is running correctly with the new
workers as the old workers die off.

</li>
<li>If everything seems ok, then send QUIT to the old master. You&#8216;re
done!

<p>
If something is broken, then send HUP to the old master to reload the
config and restart its workers. Then send QUIT to the new master process.
</p>
</li>
</ol>
