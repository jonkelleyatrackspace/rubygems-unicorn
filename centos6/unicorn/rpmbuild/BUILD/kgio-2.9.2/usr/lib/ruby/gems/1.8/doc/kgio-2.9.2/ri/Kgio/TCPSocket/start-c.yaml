- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::VERB 
  body: "     Kgio::TCPSocket.start('127.0.0.1', 80) -&gt; socket\n"
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Creates a new Kgio::TCPSocket object and initiates a non-blocking connection. The caller should select/poll on the socket for writability before attempting to write or optimistically attempt a write and handle :wait_writable or Errno::EAGAIN.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Unlike the TCPSocket.new in Ruby, this does NOT perform DNS lookups (which is subject to a different set of timeouts and best handled elsewhere).
