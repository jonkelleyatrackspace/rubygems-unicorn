      <h1><a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a>: Rack HTTP server for fast clients and Unix</h1>
<p>
\<a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> is an HTTP server for Rack
applications designed to only serve fast clients on low-latency,
high-bandwidth connections and take advantage of features in Unix/Unix-like
kernels. Slow clients should only be served by placing a reverse proxy
capable of fully buffering both the the request and response in between \<a
href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> and slow clients.
</p>
<h2>Features</h2>
<ul>
<li>Designed for Rack, Unix, fast clients, and ease-of-debugging. We cut out
everything that is better supported by the operating system, <a
href="http://nginx.net/">nginx</a> or <a
href="http://rack.github.io/">Rack</a>.

</li>
<li>Compatible with Ruby 1.8 and later. Rubinius support is in-progress.

</li>
<li>Process management: \<a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> will
reap and restart workers that die from broken apps. There is no need to
manage multiple processes or ports yourself. \<a
href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> can spawn and manage any number
of worker processes you choose to scale to your backend.

</li>
<li>Load balancing is done entirely by the operating system kernel. Requests
never pile up behind a busy worker process.

</li>
<li>Does not care if your application is thread-safe or not, workers all run
within their own isolated address space and only serve one client at a time
for maximum robustness.

</li>
<li>Supports all Rack applications, along with pre-Rack versions of Ruby on
Rails via a Rack wrapper.

</li>
<li>Builtin reopening of all log files in your application via USR1 signal.
This allows logrotate to rotate files atomically and quickly via rename
instead of the racy and slow copytruncate method. \<a
href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> also takes steps to ensure
multi-line log entries from one request all stay within the same file.

</li>
<li>nginx-style binary upgrades without losing connections. You can upgrade \<a
href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a>, your entire application,
libraries and even your Ruby interpreter without dropping clients.

</li>
<li>before_fork and after_fork hooks in case your application has special needs
when dealing with forked processes. These should not be needed when the
&quot;preload_app&quot; directive is false (the default).

</li>
<li>Can be used with copy-on-write-friendly memory management to save memory
(by setting &quot;preload_app&quot; to true).

</li>
<li>Able to listen on multiple interfaces including UNIX sockets, each worker
process can also bind to a private port via the after_fork hook for easy
debugging.

</li>
<li>Simple and easy Ruby DSL for configuration.

</li>
<li>Decodes chunked transfers on-the-fly, thus allowing upload progress
notification to be implemented as well as being able to tunnel arbitrary
stream-based protocols over HTTP.

</li>
</ul>

contributors (see logs in git). It is based on Mongrel 1.1.5. Mongrel is

<p>
\<a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> is licensed under (your
choice) of the GPLv2 or later (GPLv3+ preferred), or Ruby (1.8)-specific

</p>
<h2>Install</h2>
<p>
The library consists of a C extension so you&#8216;ll need a C compiler and
Ruby development libraries/headers.
</p>
<p>
You may install it via RubyGems on RubyGems.org:
</p>
<pre>
  gem install unicorn
</pre>
<p>
You can get the latest source via git from the following locations (these
versions may not be stable):
</p>
<pre>
  git://bogomips.org/unicorn.git
  git://repo.or.cz/unicorn.git (mirror)
</pre>
<p>
You may browse the code from the web and download the latest snapshot
tarballs here:
</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://bogomips.org/unicorn.git">bogomips.org/unicorn.git</a>
(cgit)

</li>
<li><a href="http://repo.or.cz/w/unicorn.git">repo.or.cz/w/unicorn.git</a>
(gitweb)

</li>
</ul>
<p>
See the HACKING guide on how to contribute and build prerelease gems from
git.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<h3>non-Rails Rack applications</h3>
<p>
In APP_ROOT, run:
</p>
<pre>
  unicorn
</pre>
<h3>for Rails applications (should work for all 1.2 or later versions)</h3>
<p>
In RAILS_ROOT, run:
</p>
<pre>
  unicorn_rails
</pre>
<p>
\<a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> will bind to all interfaces
on TCP port 8080 by default. You may use the +&#8212;listen/-l+ switch to
bind to a different address:port or a UNIX socket.
</p>
<h3>Configuration File(s)</h3>
<p>
\<a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> will look for the config.ru
file used by rackup in APP_ROOT.
</p>
<p>
For deployments, it can use a config file for \<a
href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a>-specific options specified by
the +&#8212;config-file/-c+ command-line switch. See <a
href="../classes/Unicorn/Configurator.html">Unicorn::Configurator</a> for
the syntax of the \<a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a>-specific
options. The default settings are designed for maximum out-of-the-box
compatibility with existing applications.
</p>
<p>
Most command-line options for other Rack applications (above) are also
supported. Run `unicorn -h` or `unicorn_rails -h` to see command-line
options.
</p>
<h2>Disclaimer</h2>
<p>
There is NO WARRANTY whatsoever if anything goes wrong, but <a
href=".././ISSUES.html">let us know</a> and we&#8216;ll try our best to fix
it.
</p>
<p>
\<a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> is designed to only serve
fast clients either on the local host or a fast LAN. See the PHILOSOPHY and
DESIGN documents for more details regarding this.

requests) go to the mailing list/newsgroup. See the ISSUES document for
