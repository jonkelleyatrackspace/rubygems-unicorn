- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: When enabled, unicorn will check the client connection by writing the beginning of the HTTP headers before calling the application.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This will prevent calling the application for clients who have disconnected while their connection was queued.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: This only affects clients connecting over Unix domain sockets and TCP via loopback (127.*.*.*). It is unlikely to detect disconnects if the client is on a remote host (even on a fast LAN).

  body: This option cannot be used in conjunction with :tcp_nopush.
