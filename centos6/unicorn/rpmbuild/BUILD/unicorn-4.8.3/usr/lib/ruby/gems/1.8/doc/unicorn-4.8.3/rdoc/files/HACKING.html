<h2>Polyglot Infrastructure</h2>
<p>
Like Mongrel, we use Ruby where it makes sense, and Ragel with C where it
helps performance. All of the code that actually runs your Rack application
is written Ruby, Ragel or C.
</p>
<p>
As far as tests and documentation goes, we&#8216;re not afraid to embrace
Unix and use traditional Unix tools where they make sense and get the job
done.
</p>
<h3>Tests</h3>
<p>
Tests are good, but slow tests make development slow, so we make tests
faster (in parallel) with GNU make (instead of Rake) and avoiding RubyGems.
</p>
<p>
Users of GNU-based systems (such as GNU/Linux) usually have GNU make
installed as &quot;make&quot; instead of &quot;gmake&quot;.
</p>
<p>
Since we don&#8216;t load RubyGems by default, loading Rack properly
requires setting up RUBYLIB to point to where Rack is located. Not loading
RubyGems drastically lowers the time to run the full test suite. You may
setup a &quot;local.mk&quot; file in the top-level working directory to
setup your RUBYLIB and any other environment variables. A
&quot;local.mk.sample&quot; file is provided for reference.
</p>
<p>
Running the entire test suite with 4 tests in parallel:
</p>
<pre>
  gmake -j4 check
</pre>
<p>
Running just one unit test:
</p>
<pre>
  gmake test/unit/test_http_parser.rb
</pre>
<p>
Running just one test case in a unit test:
</p>
<pre>
  gmake test/unit/test_http_parser.rb--test_parse_simple.n
</pre>
<h3>HttpServer</h3>
<p>
We strive to write as little code as possible while still maintaining
readability. However, readability and flexibility may be sacrificed for
performance in hot code paths. For Ruby, less code generally means faster
code.
</p>
<p>
Memory allocation should be minimized as much as practically possible.
Buffers for IO#readpartial are preallocated in the hot paths to avoid
building up garbage. Hash assignments use frozen strings to avoid the
duplication behind-the-scenes.
</p>
<p>
We spend as little time as possible inside signal handlers and instead
defer handling them for predictability and robustness. Most of the
Unix-specific things are in the Unicorn::HttpServer class. Unix systems
programming experience will come in handy (or be learned) here.
</p>
<h3>Documentation</h3>
<p>
We use RDoc 2.5.x with Darkfish for documentation as much as possible, if
you&#8216;re on Ruby 1.8 you want to install the latest &quot;rdoc&quot;
gem. Due to the lack of RDoc-to-manpage converters we know about,
we&#8216;re writing manpages in Markdown and converting to troff/HTML with
Pandoc.
</p>
<p>
Please wrap documentation at 72 characters-per-line or less (long URLs are
exempt) so it is comfortably readable from terminals.
</p>
<p>
When referencing mailing list posts, use &quot;<a
href="http://bogomips.org/unicorn-public/m/$MESSAGE_ID.html">bogomips.org/unicorn-public/m/$MESSAGE_ID.html</a>&quot;
if possible since the Message-ID remains searchable even if a particular
site becomes unavailable.
</p>
<h3>Ruby/C Compatibility</h3>
<p>
We target Ruby 1.8.6+, 1.9 and will target Rubinius as it becomes
production-ready. We need the Ruby implementation to support fork, exec,
pipe, UNIX signals, access to integer file descriptors and ability to use
unlinked files.
</p>
<p>
All of our C code is OS-independent and should run on compilers supported
by the versions of Ruby we target.
</p>
<h3>Ragel Compatibility</h3>
<p>
We target the latest released version of Ragel and will update our code to
keep up with new releases. Packaged tarballs and gems include the generated
source code so they will remain usable if compatibility is broken.
</p>
<h2>Contributing</h2>
<p>
Contributions are welcome in the form of patches, pull requests, code
review, testing, documentation, user support or any other feedback is
welcome. The mailing list is the central coordination point for all user
and developer feedback and bug reports.
</p>
<h3>Submitting Patches</h3>
<p>
Follow conventions already established in the code and do not exceed 80
characters per line.
</p>
<p>
Inline patches (from &quot;git format-patch -M&quot;) to the mailing list
are preferred because they allow code review and comments in the reply to
the patch.
</p>
<p>
We will adhere to mostly the same conventions for patch submissions as git
itself. See the <a
href="https://git.kernel.org/cgit/git/git.git/tree/Documentation/SubmittingPatches">SubmittingPatches</a>
document distributed with git on on patch submission guidelines to follow.
Just don&#8216;t email the git mailing list or maintainer with <a
href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> patches :)
</p>
<h2>Building a Gem</h2>
<p>
In order to build the gem, you must install the following components:
</p>
<pre>
 * wrongdoc
 * pandoc
</pre>
<p>
You can build the <a href="../classes/Unicorn.html">Unicorn</a> gem with
the following command:
</p>
<pre>
  gmake gem
</pre>
<h2>Running Development Versions</h2>
<p>
It is easy to install the contents of your git working directory:
</p>
<p>
Via RubyGems (RubyGems 1.3.5+ recommended for prerelease versions):
</p>
<pre>
  gmake install-gem
</pre>
<p>
Without RubyGems (via setup.rb):
</p>
<pre>
  gmake install
</pre>
<p>
It is not at all recommended to mix a RubyGems installation with an
installation done without RubyGems, however.
