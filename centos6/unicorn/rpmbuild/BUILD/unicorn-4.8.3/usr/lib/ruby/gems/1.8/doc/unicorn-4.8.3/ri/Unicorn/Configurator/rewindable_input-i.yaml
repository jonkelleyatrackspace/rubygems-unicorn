- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: Toggles making \env[\&quot;rack.input\&quot;] rewindable. Disabling rewindability can improve performance by lowering I/O and memory usage for applications that accept uploads. Keep in mind that the Rack 1.x spec requires \env[\&quot;rack.input\&quot;] to be rewindable, so this allows intentionally violating the current Rack 1.x spec.
- !ruby/struct:SM::Flow::P 
  body: <tt>rewindable_input</tt> defaults to <tt>true</tt> when used with Rack 1.x for Rack conformance. When Rack 2.x is finalized, this will most likely default to <tt>false</tt> while still conforming to the newer (less demanding) spec.
