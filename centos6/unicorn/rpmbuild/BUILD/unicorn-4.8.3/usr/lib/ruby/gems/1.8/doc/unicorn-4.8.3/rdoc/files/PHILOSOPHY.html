      <h1>The Philosophy Behind unicorn</h1>
<p>
Being a server that only runs on Unix-like platforms, unicorn is strongly
tied to the Unix philosophy of doing one thing and (hopefully) doing it
well. Despite using HTTP, unicorn is strictly a <em>backend</em>
application server for running Rack-based Ruby applications.
</p>
<h2>Avoid Complexity</h2>
<p>
Instead of attempting to be efficient at serving slow clients, unicorn
relies on a buffering reverse proxy to efficiently deal with slow clients.
</p>
<p>
unicorn uses an old-fashioned preforking worker model with blocking I/O.
Our processing model is the antithesis of more modern (and theoretically
more efficient) server processing models using threads or non-blocking I/O
with events.
</p>
<h3>Threads and Events Are Hard</h3>
<p>
&#8230;to many developers. Reasons for this is beyond the scope of this
document. unicorn avoids concurrency within each worker process so you have
fewer things to worry about when developing your application. Of course
unicorn can use multiple worker processes to utilize multiple CPUs or
spindles. Applications can still use threads internally, however.
</p>
<h2>Slow Clients Are Problematic</h2>
<p>
Most benchmarks we&#8216;ve seen don&#8216;t tell you this, and unicorn
doesn&#8216;t care about slow clients&#8230; but <em>you</em> should.
</p>
<p>
A &quot;slow client&quot; can be any client outside of your datacenter.
Network traffic within a local network is always faster than traffic that
crosses outside of it. The laws of physics do not allow otherwise.
</p>
<p>
Persistent connections were introduced in HTTP/1.1 reduce latency from
connection establishment and TCP slow start. They also waste server
resources when clients are idle.
</p>
<p>
Persistent connections mean one of the unicorn worker processes (depending
on your application, it can be very memory hungry) would spend a
significant amount of its time idle keeping the connection alive <em>and
not doing anything else</em>. Being single-threaded and using blocking I/O,
a worker cannot serve other clients while keeping a connection alive. Thus
unicorn does not implement persistent connections.
</p>
<p>
If your application responses are larger than the socket buffer or if
you&#8216;re handling large requests (uploads), worker processes will also
be bottlenecked by the speed of the <b>client</b> connection. You should
not allow unicorn to serve clients outside of your local network.
</p>
<h2>Application Concurrency != Network Concurrency</h2>
<p>
Performance is asymmetric across the different subsystems of the machine
and parts of the network. CPUs and main memory can process gigabytes of
data in a second; clients on the Internet are usually only capable of a
tiny fraction of that. unicorn deployments should avoid dealing with slow
clients directly and instead rely on a reverse proxy to shield it from the
effects of slow I/O.
</p>
<h2>Improved Performance Through Reverse Proxying</h2>
<p>
By acting as a buffer to shield unicorn from slow I/O, a reverse proxy will
inevitably incur overhead in the form of extra data copies. However, as I/O
within a local network is fast (and faster still with local sockets), this
overhead is negligible for the vast majority of HTTP requests and
responses.
</p>
<p>
The ideal reverse proxy complements the weaknesses of unicorn. A reverse
proxy for unicorn should meet the following requirements:
</p>
<ol>
<li>It should fully buffer all HTTP requests (and large responses). Each
request should be &quot;corked&quot; in the reverse proxy and sent as fast
as possible to the backend unicorn processes. This is the most important
feature to look for when choosing a reverse proxy for unicorn.

</li>
<li>It should spend minimal time in userspace. Network (and disk) I/O are
system-level tasks and usually managed by the kernel. This may change if
userspace TCP stacks become more popular in the future; but the reverse
proxy should not waste time with application-level logic. These concerns
should be separated

</li>
<li>It should avoid context switches and CPU scheduling overhead. In many
(most?) cases, network devices and their interrupts are only be handled by
one CPU at a time. It should avoid contention within the system by
serializing all network I/O into one (or few) userspace processes. Network
I/O is not a CPU-intensive task and it is not helpful to use multiple CPU
cores (at least not for GigE).

</li>
<li>It should efficiently manage persistent connections (and pipelining) to
slow clients. If you care to serve slow clients outside your network, then
these features of HTTP/1.1 will help.

</li>
<li>It should (optionally) serve static files. If you have static files on your
site (especially large ones), they are far more efficiently served with as
few data copies as possible (e.g. with sendfile() to completely avoid
copying the data to userspace).

</li>
</ol>
<p>
nginx is the only (Free) solution we know of that meets the above
requirements.
</p>
<p>
Indeed, the folks behind unicorn have deployed nginx as a reverse-proxy not
only for Ruby applications, but also for production applications running
Apache/mod_perl, Apache/mod_php and Apache Tomcat. In every single case,
performance improved because application servers were able to use backend
resources more efficiently and spend less time waiting on slow I/O.
</p>
<h2>Worse Is Better</h2>
<p>
Requirements and scope for applications change frequently and drastically.
Thus languages like Ruby and frameworks like Rails were built to give
developers fewer things to worry about in the face of rapid change.
</p>
<p>
On the other hand, stable protocols which host your applications (HTTP and
TCP) only change rarely. This is why we recommend you NOT tie your
rapidly-changing application logic directly into the processes that deal
with the stable outside world. Instead, use HTTP as a common RPC protocol
to communicate between your frontend and backend.
</p>
<p>
In short: separate your concerns.
</p>
<p>
Of course a theoretical &quot;perfect&quot; solution would combine the
pieces and <em>maybe</em> give you better performance at the end of the
day, but that is not the Unix way.
</p>
<h2>Just Worse in Some Cases</h2>
<p>
unicorn is not suited for all applications. unicorn is optimized for
applications that are CPU/memory/disk intensive and spend little time
waiting on external resources (e.g. a database server or external API).
</p>
<p>
unicorn is highly inefficient for Comet/reverse-HTTP/push applications
where the HTTP connection spends a large amount of time idle. Nevertheless,
the ease of troubleshooting, debugging, and management of unicorn may still
outweigh the drawbacks for these applications.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="http://rainbows.bogomips.org/">Rainbows!</a> aims to fill the
gap for odd corner cases where the nginx + unicorn combination is not
enough. While Rainbows! management/administration is largely identical to
unicorn, Rainbows! is far more ambitious and has seen little real-world
usage.
