  body: "If the Content-Length of the HTTP request is known (as is the common case for POST requests), then ios.read(length [, buffer]) will block until the specified length is read (or it is the last chunk). Otherwise, for uncommon &quot;Transfer-Encoding: chunked&quot; requests, ios.read(length [, buffer]) will return immediately if there is any data and only block when nothing is available (providing IO#readpartial semantics)."
