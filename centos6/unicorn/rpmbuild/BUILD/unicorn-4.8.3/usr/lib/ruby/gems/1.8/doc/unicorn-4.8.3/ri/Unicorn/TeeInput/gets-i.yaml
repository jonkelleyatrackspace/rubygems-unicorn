  body: Reads the next ``line'' from the I/O stream; lines are separated by the global record separator ($/, typically &quot;\n&quot;). A global record separator of nil reads the entire unread contents of ios. Returns nil if called at the end of file. This takes zero arguments for strict Rack::Lint compatibility, unlike IO#gets.
