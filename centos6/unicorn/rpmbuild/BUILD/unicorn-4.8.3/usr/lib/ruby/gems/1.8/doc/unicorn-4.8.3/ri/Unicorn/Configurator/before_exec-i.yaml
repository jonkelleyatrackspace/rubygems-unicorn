  body: sets the before_exec hook to a given Proc object. This Proc object will be called by the master process right before exec()-ing the new unicorn binary. This is useful for freeing certain OS resources that you do NOT wish to share with the reexeced child process. There is no corresponding after_exec hook (for obvious reasons).
