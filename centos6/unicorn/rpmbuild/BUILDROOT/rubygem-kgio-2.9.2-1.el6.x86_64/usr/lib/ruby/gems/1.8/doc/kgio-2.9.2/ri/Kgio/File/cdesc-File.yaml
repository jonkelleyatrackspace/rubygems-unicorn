  body: This subclass of the core File class adds the &quot;tryopen&quot; singleton method for opening files. A single &quot;tryopen&quot; and check for the return value may be used to avoid unnecessary stat(2) syscalls or File.open exceptions when checking for the existence of a file and opening it.
